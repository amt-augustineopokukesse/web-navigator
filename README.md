# Web Navigator
> This project uses Linear Data Structures (Stacks) to simulate the navigational operations of a web browser such as :

- opening a new web page,
- navigating back a page and
- going forward a page. 

The Stack class maintains the history of visited pages with a backPages stack and a nextPages stack.

## To Open
run <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">node stack.js</mark> in your terminal.
